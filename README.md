# Generative Latent Space Optimization

[Generative Latent Space Optimization](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryj38zWRb) (GLO) is perhaps one of the simplest DL-based Generative model there is. The central idea is to leverage the inductive-bias of conv-nets to create a generative model. GLO maps a *learnable* noise vector to each image of training dataset and alternatively optimizes these noise vectors and a conv-net. One can run this notebook in [colab](colab.research.google.com) using this [link](http://goo.gl/cis4bj)
